This is a telegram bot that can roll d4-6-8-10-12-20-100 using "/roll <argument>". It's possible to roll multiple dice of one type at once, for example: "/roll 4d6" will roll a d6 4 times and return the single values and the sum.

To only keep the highest dice rolls ad h<number> with number being how many dice you want to keep of the ones you rolled. For example: "/roll 4d6h3" will return the 3 highest rolls of your d6 and their sum.
To host your own Telegram bot swap the 'TOKEN' string with your own bot token.
